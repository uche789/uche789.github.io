<p>As someone who has worked in the software industry for a few years, I would like to share what I think are the essential things you should know if you are interested in becoming a frontend web developer. These are the things I wished I had taken more seriously when I started out as a full-stack web developer (trust me, I made many mistakes in my early days).</p>

<h2 id="1-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms">1. Learn data structures and algorithms</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s alright to use resources such as EggHead, Coursera and Codeacademy to learn how to create your first web application but in my honest opinion, understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for any programmer, developer or computer scientist. Data structures will allow you to organize data in a way that can be used more efficiently and understanding algorithms is key to problem-solving.</p>

<p><em>Check out <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-algorithms-and-data-structures-for-competitive-programming/">Top 10 Algorithms and Data Structures for Competitive Programming</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>I am hoping to cover data structures and algorithms in a separate article. Stay tuned!</strong></p>

<h2 id="2-have-a-proper-understanding-of-javascript">2. Have a proper understanding of Javascript</h2>
<p>Javascript is a powerful language that can be both flexible and structured. Donâ€™t do my mistake of thinking JQuery is a replacement for Javascript ðŸ˜…. Itâ€™s not!</p>

<p>Understanding concepts suchs as prototypes, modular design, and observer pattern will only help you to become a better Javascript developer (<em>for further reading, check out <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15">JavaScript Design Patterns</a></em>)</p>

<h2 id="3-css-and-html-markup-are-inseparable">3. CSS and HTML markup are inseparable</h2>
<p>One lesson I learned the hard way is that the way you write your HTML will determine how your clean and properly structured your CSS will be. If your HTML code is messy, you can bet that your CSS will be messy as well. Itâ€™s never too early to learn how to write proper HTML and CSS. I recommend ISOBARâ€™s Frontend <a href="https://isobar-us.github.io/code-standards/#html_html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://isobar-us.github.io/code-standards/#css_css">CSS</a> coding standards guide.</p>

<p>If you are using web frameworks such as React, Vue or Angular, always stick to creating simple, single-responsible components with scoped CSS. Think of components as lego blocks that will be used to build larger features or modules.</p>

<h2 id="4-study-and-code-a-lot">4. Study and code a lot</h2>
<p>You can only get better by studing about programming, reading and writing code. Look for Javascript libraries and open-sourced projects on sites like <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> to glean useful information on how to write clean and efficient code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-final-thoughts">Conclusion and final thoughts</h2>

<p>I highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mdn web docs</a> to build your knowlegde of web development and clear any doubts you might have regarding CSS, HTML and Javascript.</p>

<p>Becoming a skilled frontend developer takes time and effort, but with the right education, resources, tools and, most importantly, determination, youâ€™ll definitely get there.</p>

<p><em>Goodluck on your journey!</em></p>
