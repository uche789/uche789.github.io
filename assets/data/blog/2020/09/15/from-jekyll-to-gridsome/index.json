I definitely didn’t want a CMS system like Wordpress or Ghost and headless CMS was also out of the question. I wanted to be able to write blog posts quickly using Markdown and deploy them without effort.</p>\n<p>My journey began with flat-file CMS. I started out with Pico because a friend recommended to me. It was fairly simple to use but I found it I had to rely on plugins to get the exact behaviour I wanted and the major downside was built on PHP, which would require a little more effort than I can invest if I wanted to create custom plugins.</p>\n<p>The next option was Grav. Why it had some pretty cool features. There was honestly a lot more to setup than I expected for a simple flat-file CMS and I definitely did not need the Admin panel.</p>\n<p>Jekyll was my next stop and my introduction to static websites. It provided the simple setup and easy deployment that I needed. Although it requires, Ruby and RubyGems are required but it was honestly a breeze to get my local environment going.</p>\n<p>While I was satisfied with Jekyll, I did looked at other static website generators such as Gatsby, VuePress, Hugo, Nuxt and Gridsome. All of these options are good and personally, I don’t think one is better than the other. In the end, I decided to go with Gridsome.</p>\n<p>The reason why I decided to move away from Jekyll is because I wanted to be able to use Graphql and any other modern web framework such as Vue or React. Gridsome was the perfect choice because it’s built with Vue (which I already have experience in) and supports Graphql out of the box. From my observations, Gridsome has been super easy to use and setup (the only requirements are Node and the Gridsome CLI) and would be easy to work with for anyone with a rudimentary understanding of Vue.</p>\n","timeToRead":2}},"context":{}}
