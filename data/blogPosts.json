Design tokens are used to store variables such as typography, spacing, and colours that will be shared across platforms like web, iOS, and Android. It's a very similar concept with CSS variables, which contains values that are reused throughout a document.

It's easy to overlook performance as long as the desired functionality is achieved and in a lot of small to mid-scale projects, performance can be negligible. However, when building large-scale applications or software that processes large amounts of data, the code handling the processing should be efficient and performant.</p>\n<p>This is why Big O notation is necessary.</p>\n<p>Big O notation is a mathematical notation that denotes the efficiency of an algorithm and specifically takes into account the worst-case scenario. Big-O consists of time and space complexity.</p>\n<p>Time complexity describes the execution time of an algorithm and Space complexity describes the space it requires.</p>\n<p>Big O notations are grouped together with data structures as a means to organize, manage, and store data in a format that enables efficient access and modification. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system and very common examples include arrays, linked lists, and graphs. For example, the DOM (Document Object Model) of an HTML document is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)\">tree structure</a> consisting of nodes.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered what are the time and space complexity of javascript native functions such as indexOf, find and <code>includes</code> and how to use them efficiently?</p>\n<p>Although javascript built-in functions are quite performant and should definitely be used in place of custom solutions, they can yield terrible performance if not used correctly. For example, using <code>indexOf</code> inside a <code>for</code> loop has a time complexity of o(n^2) which is very inefficient with large sets of data.</p>\n<p>It takes time to understand and consciously incorporate Big O notation as part of your regular development process. However here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid nested loops:</strong> nested loops can a negative impact on the performance of your code when working with large data sets. It's better to work with multiple <code>for</code> loops that are not nested as the time complexity will always be o(kn) = o(n), where k is the number of loops.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Built-in functions:</strong> it is always safe to use built-in functions such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>forEach</code>, and <code>sort</code> as they have been optimized by the JavaScript engines that run them. Optionally, <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">Lodash</a> utility library provides very useful functions for common programming tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Opt for object instead of array of objects:</strong> sometimes, it's easier to work with objects instead of arrays if you can and want to associate a key or id with a data set for easy access. Using the native functions <code>Object.keys</code> and <code>Object.values</code> facilitates iterating over object properties and values.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn how to use sorting and search algorithms:</strong> I'm sure you've already heard about <em>binary search</em>, <em>merge sort</em>, and <em>quicksort</em>. Although a lot of built-in functions and libraries use these algorithms internally and in most cases you might not need to write a sorting algorithm, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of sorting and search algorithms in the event that you may have to work with a complex data structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Use variables efficiently:</strong> a variable is the name of a storage location. Variables should be declared only when need and ideally, as local as possible. Keep in mind that objects that are still referenced by your application are not cleaned up by the garbage collector.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a javascript linter:</strong> javascript linters are beneficial in optimizing your code and improve quality. JSLint and ESLint are two very popular linters. There are also may good styleguide to use when configuring your linter. I always recommend the <a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\">airbnb styleguide</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Read open-source coded and practice problem solving:</strong> reading open-source code provides a wealth of information and websites such as Codewars can be beneficial improve your problem-solving skills. Keep in mind you'll only get better the more code you write.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should you consider the time and space complexity in all of your projects? Absolutely! It doesn't matter the size of your application. Understanding Big O notation, code optimization, and efficient resource usage is an essential skill for all developers wanting to build scalable and performant applications with minimal effort.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/\">Big-O Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adrianmejia.com/how-you-can-change-the-world-learning-data-structures-algorithms-free-online-course-tutorial/\">Tutorial series: Learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for Beginners</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/b0nbon1/understanding-big-o-notation-with-javascript-25mc\">Understanding Big-O Notation With JavaScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity?\">The idea behind big O notation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/\">Codewars</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">Leetcode</a></li>\n<li><em><strong>High Performance JavaScript (Build Faster Web Application Interfaces)</strong></em> by Nicholas C.

It provided the simple setup and easy deployment that I needed. Although it requires Ruby and RubyGems, it was honestly a breeze to set up. However, it was a bit painful to set up proper code highlighting and I had to do quite a bit of tweaking to get the desired look.</p>\n<p>While I was satisfied with Jekyll, I played around with other static website generators such as Gatsby, VuePress, Hugo, Nuxt and Gridsome. All of these options are petty good and I don’t think one is better than the other. In the end, I decided to go with Gridsome.</p>\n<p>The reason why I decided to move away from Jekyll was that I wanted to be able to use Graphql and any other modern web framework such as Vue or React. Gridsome was the perfect choice because it’s built with Vue (which I already have experience in) and supports Graphql out of the box. It does help a great deal if you use the Gridsome CLI.</p>\n<p>These are the major advantages that convinced me to migrate from Jekyll to Gridsome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Ruby</li>\n<li>Out of the box code highlighting</li>\n<li>Vue and Graghql</li>\n<li>Better performance</li>\n<li>Working with Component-based architecture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, I am very satisfied with Gridsome and it feels great being able to create components again. From my observations, It will be easy to work with for anyone having a rudimentary understanding of Vue.</p>"},{"path":"/blog/2020/11/12/polling-settimeout-setinterval","tags":"javascript,performance","date":"2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Improve polling using setTimeOut","slug":"improve-polling-settimeout","excerpt":"<p><code>setTimeOut</code> and <code>setInterval</code> are very similar in that they perform an action after a given time period.

It ensures that the <code>action</code> is performed every 10 seconds. However, if the action is a request to the server and the server is slow, you could have multiple requests pending because <code>setInterval</code> will execute after the given time has elapsed, whether the previous call has been completed or not.

The bubble sort algorithm goes through a sortable array of numbers and swaps the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> arr = [<span class=\"hljs-number\">8</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">9</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">3</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">6</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>]\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> length = arr.<span class=\"hljs-property\">length</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> indicator = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> i = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; i &#x3C; length &#x26;&#x26; indicator == <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>; i++) {\n    indicator = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> j = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; j &#x3C; length - i - <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>; j++) {\n      <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (arr[j] > arr[j + <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>]) {\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> temp = arr[j]\n        arr[j] = arr[j+<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>]\n        arr[j+<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>] = temp\n        indicator = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above is a variant of the algorithm. The indicator variable will track if any of the elements have been swapped and will also indicate if the array is already sorted. The worst-case scenario is O(n2) if the array is not sorted and O(n) otherwise.</p>\n<p>Let's consider another very simple example. We want to calculate the sum of each row in a two-dimensional array and output the sum for each row in an array. We have the algorithm below to do so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> arr = [\n    [<span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">6</span>],\n    [<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">9</span>],\n    [<span class=\"hljs-number\">13</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">8</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">6</span>],\n  ]\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> result = []\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> i = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; i &#x3C; arr.<span class=\"hljs-property\">length</span>; i++) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> sum = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> j = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; j &#x3C; arr[i].<span class=\"hljs-property\">length</span>; j++) {\n      sum += arr[i][j]\n    }\n    result.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">push</span>(sum)\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nm) where m is the number of dimensions (2 in this case) and n is the size of each array.</p>\n<p>Taking the two examples above, we can easily see that logic used to deduce a solution for the bubble sort can easily be applied to the second problem.</p>\n<p>However, there exist a set problems that have only been proven to be solved with an exponential-time algorithm (O(2n)). These problems are known as NP problems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/p_np.png\" alt=\">Diagram of P ≠ NP\">\n</p>\n<p>Diagram of P ≠ NP (left) and P = NP (right). It is widely believed that P ≠ NP.</p>\n<h3>NP (non-deterministic polynomial time)</h3>\n<p>NP problems consist of the set of problems whose solution can be verified in polynomial time but there is no known algorithm that can easily solve them. Examples include 0-1 Knapsack, the traveling salesman, boolean satisfiability problem, and the subset sum problem. P problems were once NP problems proven to be solvable in polynomial time.</p>\n<p>NP complexity class of problems can be broken down into three sets: NP, NP-Hard, and NP-Complete.</p>\n<h3>NP-Hard and NP-Complete</h3>\n<p>For a problem to belong to the NP set, it has to be a decision problem with solutions of polynomial length.</p>\n<p>NP-hardness refers to the set of problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. The hardest of these problems are NP-Complete. If you take a look at the diagram above of P ≠ NP, you can see that NP-Hard problems cab be neither NP-Complete nor NP. These problems are difficult or impossible to check if they are decidable (returning a true of false value). An example of an NP is the halting problem. The halting problem tries to verify if given an algorithm, will it halt or continue in an infinite loop. There is no existing algorithm that can prove if a function will halt or run forever.</p>\n<p>NP-Complete problems are NP-Hard problems that have been proven to be decidable in polynomial time (NP-Complete is a subset of NP and NP-Hard). A very good is Sudoku. In an NxN grid where N is the number of rows and columns, the number in a cell should be unique for it's row and column. When a Sudoku grid is solved, it's fairly easy to verify the solution:</p>\n<p>Here is a quick solution using a nested loop that checks if each row in the grid has a unique value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> grid = <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">completeGrid</span>()\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> isSolved = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> i = grid; i &#x3C; grid.<span class=\"hljs-property\">length</span>; i++) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> unique = []\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> j = grid; j &#x3C; grid.<span class=\"hljs-property\">length</span>; j++) {\n      <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> cell = grid[i][j]\n      \n      <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (unique.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">includes</span>(cell)) {\n        isSolved = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">false</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">break</span>\n      }\n\n      unique.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">push</span>(cell)\n    } \n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The time complexity for the alogirithm will alway be O(nn) irrespective of how large the grid is. The question is what is the complexity of the <code>completeGrid</code> function.</p>\n<p>This is different when we want to write an algorithm that can solve an NxN sudoku grid where N can be a very large number.</p>\n<h3>Why is the P versus NP problem important?</h3>\n<p>If it can be proven to solve just one problem in NP-Complete polynomial time, all NP problems become P problems. That means that problems that we taught were initially hard will become very easy to solve. This will open to a vast improvement and milestones in technology such as in the field of medicine where we can easily find cures to complex diseases and even cancer. However, it would pose a significant negative impact on crytopgraphy, which depends on algorithms that are NP-hard.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction to Algorithms</strong> by Thomas H.

This has always been my advice to aspiring frontend developers. While it's beneficial to explore various technologies and frameworks through small projects or extensive reading, the best way to grow your skills is by building a scalable project that you can continually build upon as you learn new things and discover new use cases.</p>\n<p>My favourite side projects are productivity apps. There are numerous productivity apps in the market, such as Todoist, Trello, Google Calendar, and Habitica. However, I thought, why not build one tailored to my needs using frontend technologies I'm less familiar with?</p>\n<p>Amidst my work and various other personal projects, I began creating my planner app that is a combination of todo lists and habit tracker. I set five strict criteria for the app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It had to be a Vue 3 app.</li>\n<li>It had to use at least one JavaScript feature I had no experience with.</li>\n<li>It needed to be designed with accessibility in mind.</li>\n<li>It had to be a progressive web app (PWA).</li>\n<li>It had to be testable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The technologies I ended up using were Vue 3, Pinia for state management, web workers, IndexedDB for storage, and Vitest for testing.</p>\n<h2>Ideation</h2>\n<p>Like anyone, I begin every new project by brainstorming ideas. As the primary user of the application, I wanted it to be straightforward and easy to use. I narrowed down the core use cases to three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user should be able to create tasks for any future date.</li>\n<li>A user can create a list and add tasks to it.</li>\n<li>A user can establish habits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on these use cases, I developed my requirements and defined the user journey.</p>\n<p>Next, I moved on to the design phase. I sketched wireframes to determine component positioning, page flow, and the overall user journey. Once satisfied with the initial design, I used Figma to create the pages and components. Tailwind CSS assisted in establishing the colour theme and building the basic reusable components. The final design was simple, clean, and easy to implement.</p>\n<h2>Learning more about progressive web apps</h2>\n<p>With the Vite PWA plugin, it's easy to have a basic setup of PWA. I wanted to challenge myself and at least a rudimentary understanding of the setup required to have a PWA compliant application. The Chrome team behind Web.dev have created an excellent course (<a href=\"https://web.dev/learn/pwa\">https://web.dev/learn/pwa</a>) to understand all aspects of progressive web app development. I was able to get a good understanding of the manifest and the standard practices.</p>\n<h2>IndexDB as client-side storage</h2>\n<p>For the initial phase of the project, I wanted the app to be completely serverless, so I opted for client-side storage. While I typically use local web storage for smaller web projects and simpler data, the potential complexity and possibility to use a server in the future led me to choose the IndexedDB API, which offers a storage system akin to a relational database.</p>\n<p>Setting up a database with IndexedDB was straightforward. It was easy to scan the store, add, and retrieve data. However, combining data from multiple stores proved challenging. The solution I devised required more iterations and comparisons of entries than I would have preferred, impacting overall data retrieval performance. I think my mistake was treating IndexedDB too much like a traditional relational database; a simpler structure would have been more effective.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the asynchronous nature of the IndexedDB API required careful consideration of how to use the database across the application.</p>\n<h2>Leveraging web workers</h2>\n<p>Web workers were something I had known about for a long time but had little to no experience with. I wanted to change that, so I created a small use case that would allow me to gradually introduce the concept into my project: cleaning up old or expired entries from the app. Web workers operate in the background and do not use the main thread, which keeps it free to handle user interactions without lag.</p>\n<p>The implementation of the web worker for this use case is fairly simple. The application only needed to be aware via a message when the cleaning started and ended. Exceptions were handled in such a way that the failure had no impact on functionality. This is a relatively simple use of web workers, but there are many possibilities for further exploration. I would like to introduce proper client-side caching to see how this positively impacts efficiency and performance.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Sometime last year, I took some courses in UX design to gain a better understanding of the field and how I can improve my approach to user experience. One aspect of these courses was accessibility, which made me realize how often people with disabilities are overlooked in daily web development. As someone who has friends and acquaintances with disabilities, accessibility is now a significant focus in all my work. This is the first project where accessibility has been an integral part of the initial phase of development and planning.</p>\n<p>Ensuring website accessibility is straightforward with resources like the A11y Project and W3C. Additionally, modern browser DevTools come with accessibility inspectors, making it easier than ever to create inclusive websites.</p>\n<p>I found it enlightening to put myself in the shoes of someone with disabilities by navigating the app using only the keyboard and screen readers (ex: macOS VoiceOver). This exercise was invaluable in solidifying my approach to testing web applications for accessibility compliance and enhancing the user experience for everyone.</p>\n<h2>Testing with Vitest</h2>\n<p>Since switching from Jest to Vitest for my Vue projects, I've found it to be a game-changer. Vitest seamlessly integrates with Vite, requiring less setup and configuration. Its API closely mirrors Jest's, making the transition smooth with minimal learning curve. I also found Vitest to have a better overall performance in terms of speed.</p>\n<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is my preferred testing approach, as it ensures your code is testable, reliable, and has fewer bugs. However, it can be tedious to implement this approach when starting a new project under tight deadlines. I had set a specific timeline for the first phase of this project that I was unwilling to extend, especially due to my full-time job, numerous hobbies, and limited time. Therefore, I opted to compromise and prioritize testing critical components over testing the entire application.</p>\n<p>While the test coverage isn't as extensive as I'd like, I have created a strong testing groundwork for future enhancements. Over time, I plan to incrementally expand and improve the test coverage, especially with more focus on component testing (testing integrated components).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The project was enjoyable to build. It was occasionally frustrating, as the planning of the architecture could have been better, and I had to iterate over the implementation of some parts of the application. Most importantly, I learned a lot and identified areas where I could improve. While the app is far from perfect, it serves as a foundation for experimenting with new ideas and honing my skills. I had the opportunity to explore powerful JavaScript features and witness its practical benefits firsthand. There is much to improve, particularly in terms of testing coverage and user experience.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the next steps involve enhancing the app further by adding more animations, perfecting the design and accessibility, and simplifying the data structure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://simplearchitect.dev/projects/planner/setup\">App demo</a></p>"}]
