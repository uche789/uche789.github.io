I definitely didn‚Äôt want to use a CMS system like WordPress or Ghost and headless CMS would have been overkill. The goal was to write blog posts quickly using Markdown and deploy them without effort.</p>
<p>My journey began with flat-file CMS. I started out with Pico because a friend recommended it to me. It was fairly simple to use but I found I had to rely on plugins to get the exact behaviour I wanted. The major downside is that it‚Äôs built on PHP and I had to create custom plugins to get my desired functionality, which was a little more effort than I was willing to invest.</p>
<p>The next option was Grav. Why it had some pretty cool features. There was honestly a lot more to set up than I expected for a simple flat-file CMS and I definitely did not need the Admin panel.</p>
<p>Jekyll was my next stop and my introduction to static websites. It provided the simple setup and easy deployment that I needed. Although it requires Ruby and RubyGems, it was honestly a breeze to set up. However, it was a bit painful to set up proper code highlighting and I had to do quite a bit of tweaking to get the desired look.</p>
<p>While I was satisfied with Jekyll, I played around with other static website generators such as Gatsby, VuePress, Hugo, Nuxt and Gridsome. All of these options are petty good and I don‚Äôt think one is better than the other. In the end, I decided to go with Gridsome.</p>
<p>The reason why I decided to move away from Jekyll was that I wanted to be able to use Graphql and any other modern web framework such as Vue or React. Gridsome was the perfect choice because it‚Äôs built with Vue (which I already have experience in) and supports Graphql out of the box. It does help a great deal if you use the Gridsome CLI.</p>
<p>These are the major advantages that convinced me to migrate from Jekyll to Gridsome:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Ruby</li>
<li>Out of the box code highlighting</li>
<li>Vue and Graghql</li>
<li>Better performance</li>
<li>Working with Component-based architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I am very satisfied with Gridsome and it feels great being able to create components again. From my observations, It will be easy to work with for anyone having a rudimentary understanding of Vue.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="tags"><!--[--><div class="tag--bg5 tag">static-sites</div><div class="tag--bg5 tag">javascript</div><div class="tag--bg2 tag">web frameworks</div><!--]--></div><div class="divider"></div></div></main><footer><span class="copyright">¬© 2019-present Uche&#39;s Coding Corner.
