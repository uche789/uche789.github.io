The Set-Cookie header basically instructs the browser to create a cookie for the specified domain. This cookie information is then sent back to the server in subsequent requests for the domains specified.</p>\n<p>Session cookies are used to identify a user’s session and generally contain sensitive data. Session cookies must be secure.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;; Path=&lt;path-value&gt;; Domain=&lt;domain-value&gt;; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None</code></pre>\n<p>The HttpOnly and Secure attributes prevent the cookie from being accessed through the Document.cookie property, thus mitigating cross-site scripting attacks. Secure cookies are only sent back to the server when a request is made with the https:// scheme.</p>\n<p>Notice the SameSite attribute in the example cookie above. This has to be set to None in other to allow for both cross-site and same-site requests. Modern versions of Chrome and Firefox will not send the Set-Cookie header back to the server, therefore preventing CORS requests.</p>\n<p>During development, it will sometimes be necessary to maintain the session of an authenticated user, and since secure cookies can only be sent via https, you would need to create a self-signed certificate for your application.
