                How and where you load external scripts on a page can affect page load speed and performance. &lt;script&gt; tags were usually placed in the &lt;head&gt; section and quite often without only the src attributes. These external Scripts are loaded and executed synchronously, meaning the HTML parser is forced to wait for the resource to be fetched. If there is an issue with the server response, this could result in page blocking and a terrible user...

                I was listening to a YouTube video on Clean Code by Michael Toppa during a short break from work. This video is an awesome summary of what you should keep in my when you are coding. If youâ€™ve come across a bit of nasty code that you wrote months ago and wondered how to refactor it using clean code, then the tips in this video are a good place to start. I highly recommend that...

                As someone who has worked in the software industry for a few years, I would like to share what I think are the essential things you should know if you are interested in becoming a frontend web developer. These are the things I wished I had taken more seriously when I started out as a full-stack web developer (trust me, I made many mistakes in my early days). 1. Learn data structures and algorithms Itâ€™s...

                In my never ending quest in finding the right CSS structure that will allow easy theming, I have done a lot of reading and research into design tokens and how this will help me achieve my aim of writing CSS that can easily be overriden with little effort. In short, design tokens are used to avoid hardcoded values that are reusable in your CSS. Design tokens are used to store variables such as typography, spacing...

                This is my second attempt at writing a tech blog. Iâ€™m hoping I stick with it this time ðŸ¤ž. Iâ€™ve been trying to find the right flat-file CMS that requires minimum time to set up and I discovered Jekyll. After about 4 hours, I have a blog hosted on github pages. This blog is primarily focused on frontend development but there will occassionally be other articles on other areas of IT and Computer Science. I...
